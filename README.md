traditional media queries vs enquire.js media queries

I created this project to hone in on a problem with enquire.js (or something else, I have no idea).

##The Situation:

I have an image that should be full height of the browser. I don't care about width. For that reason, I have to use height based media queries.

For Reasons&trade; it is highly desireable to do these media queries via JS rather than traditional CSS.

##The Problem:

Increase the height of the page too fast, and the appropriate media query doesn't fire/unfire.

I've made a traditonal Media Queries page that demonstrates that there's not a problem the old fashioned way.

###More Background

When the gap between media queries

##The Solution:

???

Halp!
